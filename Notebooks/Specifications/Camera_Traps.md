### **About the Ecological Field Monitoring Protocols Manual**

This module is one of many that form the Ecological Field Monitoring Protocols Manual using the Ecological Monitoring System Australia (EMSA), available at tern.org.au/emsa-protocols-manual/. EMSA has been developed by the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) in collaboration with the Australian Government Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) to support the National Landcare Program (NLP). The protocols included in the modules build on previous work by numerous ecologists throughout the country (acknowledged in the text) and have been refined with the help of Australia's natural resource management (NRM) community. They provide users with a clear set of protocols to measure and monitor most Australian ecosystems quantitatively and repeatably to enable the reliable quantification of environmental change.

The system addresses many limitations evident in previous NRM programs that have made this change quantification difficult. These included measuring or estimating environmental occurrences with disparate and often incompatible methods, particularly over a range of geographic scales, along with previous inefficiencies in data provision and analysis. The EMSA protocols presented in the modules provide clear and proven methods (built upon previous method/s where appropriate) to accurately measure environmental change for many variables of interest in Australian terrestrial environments. The modules are supported by a toolset to collect and deliver data to the Australian Government's Biodiversity Data Repository, which will see various management, policy and research outcomes informed by the data collected.

The current set of 24 modules is not an exhaustive list, and TERN and DCCEEW may develop additional modules in the future as gaps are identified. We intend these modules and the supporting Monitor app to be widely accessible, with little assumed knowledge, using methods that NRM practitioners and ecologists can easily adopt. To support the uptake of the protocols, we are also developing a series of education and guidance materials and an in-person training course. We anticipate that users outside of the NLP may be interested in utilising these protocols. The team plans to make a version available in the near future that will be independent of the NRM project management system the monitoring, evaluation, reporting and improvement tool (MERIT), to enable that widespread use.

We acknowledge, value and respect the experiences, perspectives and cultures of Indigenous Australians. We recognise the importance of combining Indigenous and western environmental knowledge systems to improve ecological monitoring in Australia. The EMSA protocols are designed to be implemented alongside First Nations protocols, procedures and policies, and we look forward to working in partnership with Indigenous land managers on future versions of these protocols.

The protocols detailed here are freely available for widespread use by acknowledging their source. The protocols will be refined over time, so we encourage you to download the latest version before using them. We look forward to continuously improving these protocols in the same way as we utilise an adaptive management framework on the environments we monitor. We know that the data collected and supported by this program will enable analyses in novel ways and at previously impossible scales. We thank you for joining us on that journey and look forward to working with you to implement the EMSA system to benefit all Australians.

We also welcome you to provide feedback to tern@adelaide.edu.au

## **1\. Module overview**

### **1.1 Available protocols**

This module includes three complementary camera trapping protocols, each of which collects all associated metadata in a standardised manner in the Monitor app:

1. **Camera trap deployment** \- camera traps deployed at points of interest or in an array or Fauna Plot.  
2. **Camera trap re-equipping** \- camera trap batteries and SD cards replaced to extend deployment.  
3. **Camera trap retrieval** \- camera traps retrieved at the end of the deployment period.

The deployment protocol can be used to simply deploy camera traps at one or more features of interest, such as a waterpoint or trail, as well as in an array (i.e. grid or transect), or in Fauna Plots in conjunction with a general vertebrate fauna survey (e.g. Gillespie et al. 2015). Camera traps may also be deployed using a combination of these approaches to improve the probability of detecting a species or maximise the species inventory when undertaking fauna monitoring within a project area.

Camera traps are often deployed at bait stations to attract fauna into the detection zone, which increases the likelihood of detection (Gillespie et al. 2015). As such, the deployment protocol provides an option for passive (without lure or bait) and active (with lure or bait) survey designs, including monitoring a bait station, carcass or palatable plant. This allows the protocol to be tailored to monitor vertebrate pest species, including feral cats, wild dogs, foxes, feral pigs, deer, rabbits, goats and camels.

The deployment protocol includes the procedures and guidelines for broadly locating camera trap points in the field, micrositing the exact camera trap point locations to optimise fauna detections, site preparation, installing bait stations, and recording all associated metadata (e.g. survey type, camera trap make, model and settings, camera trap location and orientation, focal point, target species if applicable, bait station details, deployment period) in a standardised manner directly into the Monitor app.

The module covers pre-field survey tasks, including camera trap, SD card and battery preparation (see Appendix 1), as well as study design and planning considerations to maximise species detection and identification (see Appendix 2).

Complete lists of data collection fields are provided in the Monitor app, as well as the TERN Linked Data website. Data standards are based on the Camera Trap Metadata Standard developed by Forrester et al. (2016), an open data standard for storing and sharing camera trap data between projects, and which offers a foundation for collecting the more detailed data needed for downstream analyses. The standard captures information about study design, the type of camera trap used, and the location and species names for all detections, among others, in a standardised manner. The standard is compatible with the Federal Geographic Data Committee, the Darwin Core, the Ecological Metadata Language, and the Audubon Core metadata standards to allow data to be easily cross referenced with existing data repositories, such as DataONE (Forrester et al. 2016).

### **1.2 Relationship to other modules**

#### **1.2.1 Mandatory related modules**

Mandatory if deploying camera traps in a fauna plot in conjunction with a general vertebrate fauna survey:

* **Plot Selection and Layout Module** \- the Fauna Plot must be established first, and the boundaries must be defined to ensure the camera traps are deployed within the plot boundaries.

#### **1.2.2 Optional complementary related modules**

* **Vertebrate Fauna Module** \- camera traps can be used in combination with a range of other vertebrate fauna survey methods (e.g. pitfall trapping).  
* **Vegetation Mapping Module** \- fauna habitats in the project area and Fauna Plot selection can be informed by the results of the Vegetation Mapping Module.  
* **Targeted Surveys Module** \- camera traps can be deployed as part of targeted surveys and can be used in combination with a range of other targeted measures.  
* **Interventions Module** \- camera traps can be used to detect distribution and population trends associated with interventions to conserve threatened species, as well as monitor vertebrate pest population control.  
* **Opportune Module** \- opportune records can assist with camera trap placement based on any observations (direct or signs) of target species.  
* **Fauna Sign-based Surveys Module** \- camera trapping can be used in association with sign-based surveys to help verify sign-based data and assist with abundance estimates.  
* **Fauna Ground Surveys Module** \- camera trapping can be used in association with direct ground surveys to extend the survey period (i.e. 24 hrs per day) and assist with abundance estimates and individual identification.

## **2\. Introduction and background**

The Camera Trapping Module covers the use of camera traps to monitor fauna species, including vertebrate pests, across the project area. The module includes protocols for the deployment, re-equipping and retrieval of camera traps, each of which collects all associated metadata in a standardised manner. By standardising the collection of the metadata associated with camera trap deployment and image analysis, minimum data requirements can be met, methods can be replicated and more robust comparisons of results among studies can be undertaken (Meek et al. 2014a). The protocols can be used to deploy camera traps at features of interest, such as a waterpoint or trail, in an array (i.e. grid, transect), or in Fauna Plots in conjunction with a general vertebrate fauna survey.

If monitoring the behaviour of fauna under a certain set of conditions, sampling fauna at a specific set of points for experimental purposes (e.g. to examine responses of fauna to differing vegetation or specific landscape parameters), or monitoring fauna at a place of activity or gathering point such as a trail intersection, water point or nest site, targeted placement of camera traps is the most effective approach. This approach allows researchers and practitioners to monitor a large area with minimal resources and to answer specific research questions. However, this approach is highly susceptible to bias and provides a limited insight into the ecology of the greater landscape as a whole (Molloy 2018).

If using a camera trap array approach, the deployment protocol allows the flexibility to monitor the community or individual species. Surveyors can select the density and number of camera traps, and the deployment period based on the aims of their project, with this information recorded in a standarised manner among projects using the app. If undertaking a general survey of the fauna across a project or study area, an array approach is the most effective. An array can be used to sample a broad area simultaneously and uniformly it provides a better sample size than the other approaches, thereby enabling a more accurate indication of species abundance over the whole survey area. For this reason, an indicated absence (where a species is not detected) from a camera trap array sample is more likely to reflect a true absence (where a species is not present) than the other approaches. If resources are limited, establishing a transect through the most representative part of the survey area and placing camera traps at pre-determined intervals along that transect, might be the best approach. However, indicated absences obtained from transect samples cannot be reliably used as an indication of true absence. It is possible to combine grid and transect approaches (Molloy 2018).

The deployment protocol allows for camera traps to be deployed in Fauna Plots as part of general vertebrate fauna surveys, with the camera traps located within the plot based on the method being used. Two examples include the Standard Operating Procedure for Camera Trapping developed by the Department of Environment, Parks and Water Security (Northern Territory Government; Gillespie et al. 2015), and Bush Heritage Australia's Camera Trap Guidelines (Bush Heritage Australia 2021). Both standardised methodologies were developed from extensive trialling of various camera trap survey designs and consultation with a range of expert practitioners, to optimise the effectiveness and consistency of camera traps for general vertebrate fauna surveys and monitoring.

The vast majority of camera traps deployed in Australia for vertebrate fauna research and management use passive infrared (PIR) sensors (Meek et al. 2012b). PIR sensors work by sensing the movement of a body in the camera trap's detection zone that is a different temperature relative to the ambient temperature and temperature of background surface and objects (i.e. temperature in motion). This automatically triggers the camera trap to capture an image, a burst of images, or video depending on the camera trap settings. Images or video, which are continually collected over the course of a deployment in response to individuals entering the detection zone, are time and date-stamped and stored on an external SD card. The applications that camera traps can be used for are summarised in Table 1\.

### **2.2 Rationale**

The use of camera traps is popular among scientists and natural resource managers to acquire ecological data and evidence of both native and pest fauna species. Camera traps can be used to assess fauna distribution, abundance, behaviour, and community structure (Rovero et al. 2013; Meek et al. 2014b). Such widespread applications generate a profusion of data, and if metadata collection can be standardised, camera trapping has the potential to be a cornerstone of global biodiversity monitoring initiatives (Burton et al. 2015).

Camera traps do not require expert skills to install. They are less invasive, safer for both fauna and field personnel, and potentially more ethical than trapping and animal handling methods. They can be more widely used (and capture a wider range of fauna species) than other survey methods such as pitfall or box traps, which are tailored to animals of a specific size range (Welbourne et al. 2015). Despite high initial costs, camera traps are less costly than labour-intensive trapping methods in the long-term because they can be left in the field for extended periods of time (i.e. weeks-months; Dundas et al. 2019). Survey periods can be easily extended without having a large effect on overall cost, other than increasing image processing time and battery use (Welbourne et al. 2015). Camera traps are particularly useful in sampling programs in remote areas, which are typically associated with high costs and other logistical constraints (Gillespie et al. 2015), including difficulty in accessing broadly spaced and hazardous locations to install and regularly check live traps (Molloy 2018; Dundas et al. 2019). Camera traps can also capture information about several species simultaneously (Welbourne et al. 2015), and facilitate the identification of individuals for some pest species such as feral cats (Denny and Dickman 2010; Hansen et al. 2018\) and feral pigs (Broadley et al. 2019).

Although camera trapping shifts the labour requirements from field based to office based (Dundas et al. 2019), several computer processes and programs have been developed to manage camera trapping datasets and automate image processing, in particular the removal of images captured by false triggers where no animals are present (Niedballa et al. 2016; Norouzzadeh et al. 2018). Image processing can also be undertaken by junior staff and citizen scientists (e.g. DigiVol's Wildlife Spotter program; [https://volunteer.ala.org.au/wildlife-spotter](https://volunteer.ala.org.au/wildlife-spotter)), with expert staff able to focus on confirming identifications rather than wading through thousands of images.

The methodological information reported in camera trap publications and reports can vary widely, making replication of studies and comparison of results difficult (Meek et al. 2014a). For this reason, the Camera Trapping Module includes clear instructions and guidelines for deploying camera traps across Australia. Attributes of camera trapping that are covered include: (i) the make and model of the camera trap used; (ii) the camera trap settings used; and (iii) the mode of deployment (e.g. camera trap height, angle, direction). The metadata associated with these attributes is collected in a standardised manner among projects using the Monitor app, which ensures the data is correct, transparent, complete and suitable for use in ecological or natural resource management reports and peer-reviewed papers.

Standardised data collection and reporting of methods and results enables greater ease of study replication, more robust comparisons among studies, facilitates national and international reviews, and leads to improved fauna research and management outcomes (Meek et al. 2014a). A standardised approach to camera trap metadata collection is vital given the variability in performance among camera trap makes and models, the extensive range of camera trap settings now available, and differences in how camera traps are deployed in the field. Furthermore, the increasing availability of cyber infrastructure for storing and sharing digital data (e.g. from citizen science programs, through open access and data sharing frameworks) also requires the key aspects of camera trap deployment to be clear and consistent (Meek et al. 2014a).

Despite the advantages of camera traps, other fauna survey methods still have advantages, so using a combination of methods incorporating camera traps may be the most appropriate approach to surveying fauna (Gillespie et al. 2015). Survey effectiveness and cost can be improved by surveying taxonomic groups simultaneously with multiple techniques that complement one another (Welbourne et al. 2015). In recognition of this, camera trapping can be undertaken in a Fauna Plot in conjunction with a general vertebrate fauna survey, or at points of interest across a project area to supplement species inventories and gain a more thorough understanding of habitat use (Gillespie et al. 2015).

Technological advances in camera traps are regular and can provide novel insights. For this reason, the Camera Trapping Module allows for the incorporation of technological advances, with data vocabularies able to be updated to record new camera trap makes, models and specifications as these advances occur.

## **3\. Camera trap deployment protocol**

### **3.1 Field collection**

#### **3.1.1 Pre-requisites**

To ensure the integrity and quality of the data collected, camera traps must be in proper functioning order. Adequate care and maintenance of the required equipment is essential and close attention must be paid when preparing and calibrating the camera traps before they are deployed in the field.

The following tasks need to be undertaken before commencing a deployment field survey:

* Camera trap identification, firmware update and settings configuration (Appendix 1\)  
* SD card identification and formatting (Appendix 1\)  
* Batteries preparation (Appendix 1\)  
* Desiccant installation (humid/wet conditions; Appendix 1\)  
* Camera trap array development and upload (Appendix 1\)  
* Study design and planning considerations (Appendix 2).

#### **3.1.2 Time requirements**

Survey time requirements will vary depending on the number and experience of personnel, the number of camera traps being deployed, whether additional equipment is being used (e.g. bait stations, drift fence), the level of site preparation required at each camera trap point, the size of the project area, and the level of difficulty in traversing the project area.

As a general guide:

* Allow one week prior to the field survey to prepare camera traps, SD cards, batteries and camera trap arrays.  
* Allow 10-30 minutes at each camera trap point, depending if installing a bait station or carcass.  
* Allow travel time between camera trap points.  
* Consider the deployment period.

#### **3.1.3 Personnel requirements**

Personnel number and skills:

* Camera trap deployment is best conducted with two personnel, one setting up the camera traps, and the other recording the data directly into the app.  
* The surveyor deploying the camera traps should be familiar with and experienced in the operation and settings of the camera traps. If surveyors are not confident, time should be dedicated to practising, using instruction manuals, and seeking advice before conducting this protocol.  
* For large project areas and camera trap arrays, camera trap deployment is best conducted with two or more teams in separate vehicles.  
* The use of camera traps involves interference with wildlife. Therefore, scientific permits and wildlife ethics approvals are likely to be required, so always check with your local authority. Access permissions are required.

#### **3.1.4 Equipment**

**General deployment equipment:**

* Mobile device (tablet/phone) with the Monitor app pre-loaded  
* GNSS receiver capable of achieving \<30 cm accuracy (e.g. Trimble R1 or DA2), hand-held GPS, or device built-in GPS (least preferred)  
* Camera traps (same make and model)  
* Batteries as many as required per camera trap for all camera traps  
* 1 x SD card per camera trap  
* 1 x mounting post per camera trap (e.g. star dropper)  
* Mounting apparatuses (e.g. cable ties, tie wire, mounting straps)  
* Anti-theft devices and keys (e.g. cable lock straps, padlocks, security boxes)  
* Chocks to angle camera traps to features (e.g. small wooden offcuts)  
* Steel post driver or mash hammer  
* Pocket tape measure  
* Protractor  
* Compass  
* Inclinometer  
* Site preparation equipment (e.g. gloves, secateurs, pruning saw, rake, shovel)  
* Hand-held digital camera, SD card image viewer or USB-C/Lightning to SD card reader  
* Rechargeable battery chargers  
* Flagging tape.

**Project dependent equipment:**

* 1 x bait or lure per bait station  
* 1 x ventilated bait container per bait station  
* 1 x small olfactory lure container per bait station  
* 1 x mounting post per bait station  
* Dust or granular insecticide for ants  
* 1 x carcass per camera trap point  
* 2 x metal stakes and tie wire per carcass  
* Angle brackets (90°) and fasteners (horizontal camera trap orientation)  
* Drift fences (directing species towards the detection zone)  
* Cork tiles (thermal contrast between tile and species)  
* 1 x desiccant packet per camera trap (humid/wet conditions).

#### **3.1.5 Instructions and procedures**

1. The camera traps should have been prepared and calibrated prior to the field survey. If not, refer to the pre-field survey tasks (Appendix 1\) to install batteries, SD cards and desiccant packets (for humid/wet conditions), and configure the settings for each camera trap before continuing.  
2. If deploying camera traps in an array, ensure the proposed array has been uploaded to your device (csv file with 'Name', 'Latitude' and 'Longitude' columns, with latitude and longitude in decimal degrees; see Appendix 1).  
3. If deploying camera traps within a Fauna Plot, ensure the Plot Selection and Layout Module has been completed to establish the Fauna Plot and mark out the plot boundaries and trapping configuration.  
4. Select the Camera Trapping Module in the Monitor app.  
5. Select Camera Trap Deployment.  
6. Record a survey label. This is a descriptor to distinguish the camera trap deployment for subsequent re-equipping and retrieval (e.g. June 30 array deployment).  
7. Select the survey type from the following drop-down list (you can only complete one type of survey at a time):  
   * Camera trap point  
   * Camera trap array \- grid  
   * Camera trap array \- transect  
   * Fauna plot.  
8. The start date time of the deployment survey will be automatically recorded. Update if required.  
9. If a camera trap array survey type is selected, load the array planned points into the app by picking the relevant csv file (with 'Name', 'Latitude' and 'Longitude' columns, with latitude and longitude in decimal degrees).  
10. Traverse your project area and locate a proposed camera trap point, whether at a feature of interest, as part of an array or within a Fauna Plot. Approach it with the required equipment. Use the mapping interface to locate array planned points.  
11. Select the add camera trap point button.  
12. Record a camera trap point ID that is suitable for your project (e.g. CTP001). Consider you are planning to deploy a paired camera trap at the camera trap point (e.g. CTP001A and CTP001B). Consider the name of any permanent camera trap points that are being used.  
13. Record the deployment start date. The app will automatically record a deployment ID using the camera trap point ID and deployment start date (e.g. CTP001-2023-06-30 15:00:00). The deployment start date is also used to calculate the deployment period upon retrieval.  
14. If a camera trap array survey type is selected, the app will prompt you to record the distance to closest camera trap point in metres (m). The initial entry will be automatically populated for subsequent deployments, and can be updated if the minimum distance between points changes. Select the mark closest camera trap point button in order to distinguish camera trap points that have deployed camera traps among the array on the mapping interface.  
15. If the camera trap array \- transect survey type is selected, the app will prompt you to record the transect number. This will be automatically set to '1'. However, you can update this if you are deploying camera traps along multiple transects.  
16. If the fauna plot survey type is selected, the app will prompt you to select which fauna plot you are surveying in from a drop-down list of established fauna plots.  
17. If targeting a specific taxa or species, record the target taxa and target species from the drop-down lists. Multiple taxa and/or species can be added.  
18. Scan the immediate area to ensure it is suitable to secure a camera trap mounting post with the focal point in a southerly direction. If it is not suitable to secure a mounting post or there are issues with the detection zone and field of view, move to the nearest suitable area.  
19. Use a steel post driver or mash hammer to secure a camera trap mounting post into the ground in a northerly direction from your desired focal point. Ensure the post remains tall enough so the top of the mounted camera trap is a suitable height for your project needs. If there is a large tree trunk or stem in a suitable position this can be used. Ensure the post is secure or the tree trunk or stem is large enough to prevent false triggers from camera movement. Record the camera trap mount from the drop-down list (e.g. 'Star dropper', 'Tree').  
20. When standing directly at the camera trap mounting post, press the record camera trap point location button.  
21. Record the feature that will be the focal point of the camera trap from the drop-down list or input a custom value (e.g. trail, waterpoint, bait station, carcass, palatable plant). Record the distance to feature in metres (m), a feature photo and any feature comments. If relevant, record the carcass species, plant species or sign species. Multiple features can be recorded (e.g. trail and bait station).  
22. If using a bait station, install this first so you have a focal point when setting up the camera trap. Use a steel post driver or mash hammer to secure a mounting post into the ground. Ensure the post remains tall enough so the bait container is a suitable height above the ground for your project needs. Ensure the post is secure enough that it cannot be easily removed by animals. Record the bait station mount. If using a bait, place the bait in the bait container and secure to the post using a mounting apparatus. If using an olfactory lure, place the required amount inside a small container and carefully place this into the mounted bait container. If using an audio or visual lure, secure it to the post using a mounting apparatus. Record the lure height in centimetres (cm), lure type and lure variety used from the drop-down list or manual entry. Where ants may be a problem, spread dust or granular insecticide for ants around the base of the bait station.  
23. If using a carcass, install this first so you have a focal point when setting up the camera trap. Use a mash hammer to secure the two metal stakes to the ground. Do this at a distance that will allow you to secure the carcass to the stakes using wire around the neck and hind achilles tendon.  
24. If required for your project, install drift fences to direct species towards the detection zone, and/or cork tiles to create a sufficient thermal contrast between the tile, which is heated by the sun, and the species.  
25. Before mounting the camera trap, open the housing and check and record the camera trap number and SD card number.  
26. Record the camera trap information, including make, model, manufacture year (same model may vary between years), illumination, activation mechanism (e.g. 'PIR') and trigger speed in seconds. Once the data is entered for the first camera trap you configure, your previous selections will automatically appear for each subsequent camera trap you deploy during the current survey.  
27. Switch the camera trap on and navigate to the settings menu to check that the following camera trap settings have been configured to suit your project, recording each in the app as you progress:  
    * media type (i.e. image and/or video)  
    * images per trigger (for images)  
    * image interval in seconds (for images)  
    * video length in minutes and seconds (for videos)  
    * sensor sensitivity  
    * quiet period in minutes and seconds  
    * aspect ratio  
    * image quality in megapixels (for images)  
    * video resolution (for videos)  
    * day/night recording  
    * night mode shutter speed in seconds  
    * time format  
    * date and time  
    * unit of temperature  
    * battery type  
    * user label  
    * time lapse (on/off)  
    * time lapse interval in minutes and seconds (if time lapse turned on)  
    * time lapse schedule start and end (if time lapse turned on; multiple can be recorded). The app will only display the fields relevant to the media type selected. Once the data is entered for the first camera trap you configure, your previous selections will automatically appear for each subsequent camera trap you deploy during the current survey. If you wish to retain the same settings, you will just need to update the camera trap number and SD card number in the app, and user label in the camera trap and in the app. Close the camera trap housing.  
28. Using a mounting apparatus and anti-theft devices if necessary, mount the camera trap so that it is at a height to suit your project needs and facing the focal point. It should be facing south wherever possible (otherwise in a southerly direction). Use chocks to angle the camera so it captures the feature in the middle of the field of view. If required for your project, use an angle bracket to orientate the camera trap horizontally (i.e. downward-facing detection zone and field of view).  
29. Record the camera trap height in centimetres (cm), from the surface of the ground to the camera lens.  
30. Record the camera trap angle from vertical (0-90°). If using an angle bracket to orientate the camera trap horizontally, record the angle as 90°.  
31. Record the camera trap direction relative to north (0-360°) and the detection angle (°) relative to the predicted path of the target taxa/species.  
32. Record the slope and aspect. If the area is flat, record '0°' for both. See the guidelines for setting camera traps on sloped ground.  
33. Ensure that the sensor screen and camera lens are clean.  
34. Check that there are no obstacles in front of the sensor, flash unit or camera lens (e.g. branches, mounting straps, flagging tape).  
35. If required, undertake site preparation to prevent false triggers, maximise species identification and reduce fire risk to equipment. Clear all vegetation (low hanging vegetation, grass, sticks, leaves, etc.) between the camera trap and feature. Clear vegetation at least 1 m behind the feature and at least 1 m around the camera trap (to mitigate fire damage). Consider the field of view of the sensor and clear vegetation at least 1.5 m either side of the feature.  
36. Record a camera trap photo.  
37. Test if the camera trap is positioned correctly using one of the following methods:  
    * **Walk test (if available):** open the camera trap. Switch it on and navigate to the walk test function. Close the camera trap. Test the field of view by moving your hand around the focal point while watching for the red light on the camera trap to indicate when are within the field of view. Adjust the camera trap and repeat the exercise as necessary.  
    * **Trigger the camera trap:** open the camera trap. Switch it on and arm the camera trap. Close the camera trap. Trigger the camera trap by moving your hand around the focal point. If you can review the test images on your camera trap do so. If not, switch off the camera trap, remove the SD card and view the images using a hand-held digital camera, SD card image viewer or on your device using an SD card reader. Adjust the camera trap and repeat the exercise as necessary. Delete the images before arming the camera trap.  
38. Switch on and arm the camera trap. Close the camera trap ensuring the rubber seal is clean and waterproof.  
39. Position yourself or arm or leg in the detection zone to trigger a capture sequence, which is used to indicate the start of the sampling period.  
40. Record the habitat (major vegetation group) (optional).  
41. Record any additional deployment comments (optional).  
42. Select the save camera trap point button.  
43. Use flagging tape in a nearby tree to mark the location for easy camera trap re-equipping or retrieval. Ensure the flagging tape is not in the field of view of the camera trap. If there is a security risk, do not mark the location of the camera trap, it can be located using its coordinates.  
44. Repeat steps 10-43 for each proposed camera trap point for the selected survey type.  
45. Once all camera traps for the selected survey type have been deployed, complete the camera trap deployment component. The end date time of the deployment survey will be automatically recorded. Update if required. Check the data summary before queuing the collection for submission.  
46. Repeat Steps 4-45 for a different survey type (creating a new collection for each) if required.

#### **3.1.6 Additional guidelines**

The following points are adapted from Gillespie et al. (2015), Molloy (2018) and TEAM Network (2011).

**Traversing the project area**

* Disturbance of the project area should be minimised by using existing tracks and trails or establishing temporary access routes that can be used simultaneously to undertake multiple modules.  
* Some camera trap points may need to be traversed to on foot.

**Camera trap deployment**

* Look for features of interests, where fauna activity is likely to be high (e.g. water points, trail intersections).  
* Look for signs of animal paths, or natural openings through the area, such as adjacent to rock ledges or creek beds; also place camera traps in areas with contrasting vegetation structures, such as densely vegetated versus open areas.  
* Opportune observations may also give an indication of areas that could be targeted.  
* Avoid deploying camera traps in areas where there is a risk of inundation during the deployment period.  
* Deploy camera traps so that they are orientated south to prevent glare and sun damage to the camera lens and sensor, and to reduce false triggers from the rising and setting of the sun.  
* There is evidence of overheating and malfunction of camera trap batteries on days where daytime temperatures exceed 40°C. Depending on the location and time of year, shade may need to be provided to protect the back of the camera trap from sun exposure (Dundas et al. 2019).  
* If possible, try to deploy camera traps so they are on an angle relative to animal paths.  
* In sloped terrain, camera traps should be angled and parallel to the ground to ensure detection. Level camera trap points are preferable as they provide undistorted and unobstructed view of subjects, particularly smaller animals. Downward slopes increase the size of blind zones (although this can be partially rectified by angling the camera trap downward) and upward slopes reduce the photographed area and proved a greater opportunity for concealment by increasing the effect of on ground structures.  
* If camera traps are deployed in a Fauna Plot while ground trapping is being undertaken, take care to avoid ground trapping near detection zones to prevent false triggers.  
* Refer to the relevant camera trap make and model user manuals for guidance in the operation and functionality of the camera traps.  
* Check that the housing of each camera trap is properly closed to prevent moisture damaging the electronics.  
* All camera traps used in a survey should all be set up with the same settings. Refer to Appendix 2 for a summary of informed camera trap settings for different taxa.  
* An angle bracket can be used to orientate the camera trap horizontally (i.e. downward-facing detection zone and field of view) to survey small mammals and reptiles (e.g. Dundas et al. 2019; Moore et al. 2020b).  
* Where camera trap points are in a regular grid or transect array, distance between points can be recorded as a single value. However, where camera trap points are randomly or irregularly located, the distance to the closest point is recorded, which allows for values such as the average, minimum and maximum distance among the points, along with a measure of the distribution of distances (e.g. standard deviation).  
* Theft and vandalism inevitably occur. Consider the risk of this in your project area and use anti-theft devices. Cable-locking camera traps or using security boxes will act as a deterrent and is advisable in areas with high human visitation or if setting camera traps along vehicle or walking tracks.  
* When multiple camera traps are deployed it is advisable to use combination locks, or have locks keyed-alike, to avoid having to carry multiple keys into the field. Coil excess cable length up off the ground.  
* In many cases, people who discover cameras may not disturb them, but will be curious about why they are there. Attaching a small sign to the side of each camera with a brief description of the project and some contact information is likely to satisfy curiosity and may help to limit vandalism or other interference.  
* Minimise animal interference of camera traps by securing them tightly, securing the door with a cable tie, or placing the camera trap inside a metal security box. Reconyx manufacture sturdy metal cases for their cameras for additional protection if needed.

**Site preparation**

* Determine what vegetation may cause false triggers, such as overhanging branches, or plants nearby that may grow into the sensor field during deployment, and remove with secateurs or rake as necessary.  
* If deployment will extend over a growing period, dig out perennial grass and shrub bases of the cleared area.  
* Avoid piling cleared material right next to the camera trap point as this may just blow across the field of vision, triggering false images, or impede animal access.  
* If in doubt regarding vegetation clearing, set the camera trap and trigger it to take a couple of photos, then view the images on the camera trap or remove the SD card and view the images using a hand-held digital camera, SD card image viewer or on your device using a SD card reader.

**Installing bait stations**

* Standard mammal trapping bait of peanut butter, rolled oats and honey has been successfully used in surveys targeting a wide variety of small and medium-sized native mammals, such as quolls, bandicoots, possums and rodents.  
* Bait containers should be ventilated (i.e. mesh) to allow scent to escape. A suspended metal tea infuser a common option (Meek et al. 2012a; Andrewartha et al. 2021; McHugh et al. 2022). Alternatively, PVC pipe with a ventilated end cap and an overhanging cover is recommended to reduce dehydration and water diluting the bait in the wet conditions (Gillespie et al. 2015). A comparative design is the PVC Vent Cowl (Figure 21 in Meek et al. 2012b).  
* If suitable for your project, bait stations can be secured to the ground using a large tent peg rather than attached to a bait station mounting post.  
* Bait stations can also be interfered with if not secured or designed properly. Crows and some rat species are notorious for breaking into or damaging bait stations, and dingoes will readily remove bait stations that are not adequately secured.

**Installing carcasses**

* Camera trap points should be spaced at distances sufficient to minimise carcass scent travel between points, such that scavengers would have to actively forage and seek out carcasses rather than being able to move quickly from one camera trap point to another. A minimum distance of 1 km has been used in recent studies in Australia (Spencer and Newsome 2021; Spencer et al. 2021).  
* Carcasses can be sourced from management culls, simulated culls, hunter kills and road kills.  
* Any carcass that displays evidence of disease (e.g. heavy parasite loads) should not be used.  
* Following collection, carcasses should be placed in the field without freezing within 24 hours in warm conditions and within 36 hours in cool conditions.  
* Cameras should be removed, or carcass replaced, when a carcass has been reduced to skeletal remains and all edible soft tissue has been removed as the carcass loses its attraction to scavengers (Behrendorff et al. 2018).  
* Research licences or permits may be required to obtain, relocate and monitor carcasses.  
* Consider the indirect impact of carcass provision on native species before use (Spencer et al. 2021).

**Selecting palatable plants**

* Before undertaking camera trapping, determine the most palatable plants within the study area. For example, the following papers discuss plant palatability for rabbits, which are likely palatable for other species (Cooke 1988; Cooke et al. 2010; Bird et al. 2012; Cooke 2012; Mutze 2016; Mutze et al. 2016a, 2016b).  
* The preferential foraging behaviour of the target species within the area should be established through research and observation because observing grazing impacts is the only guaranteed method of determining palatability (Bohning and Wilkie 1999). Alternatively, a cafeteria study may be conducted (Arcese et al. 2014). The most palatable species is likely the most noticeably browsed species in an area (McDonald and Brandle 2009\) or the species lacking juvenile cohorts (Mutze et al. 2016b).  
* A plant's chemical and physical components determine its palatability (Forsyth et al. 2005). Palatable species generally have high protein content, carbohydrate aroma compounds and alkaloids, low tannin content, and minimal organic acids (Raufirad et al. 2016).  
* The palatability of plants depends on a wide range of complex factors such as available species, the abundance of species, season and stock type (Bohning and Wilkie 1999). Climate, topography, soil moisture, past grazing use and plant growth stage should be considered because they influence some plant species' chemical composition and palatability (Raufirad et al. 2016).  
* Where a palatable plant neighbours an unpalatable plant, the palatable plant is vulnerable to herbivory (Rautio et al. 2012). Where herbivores selectively graze, the camera should be positioned on a palatable plant neighbouring less or non-palatable plant species.  
* The selection of palatable plant species should depend on the target pest species:  
  * Goats are less selective, a consequence of adaptations that neutralise tannins and their ability to stand on their hind legs (McDonald and Brandle 2009). As a result, goats prefer the species most prevalent in the landscape (Raufirad et al. 2016).  
  * Deer preference depends on the ecosystem in a temperate forest, select species with lower leaf fibre content (Forsyth et al. 2005), and in a grassland, preference species with a greater specific leaf area (Lloyd et al. 2010).  
  * Rabbits prefer palatable, short-lived species such as acacias and casuarinas as opposed to less palatable, long-lived eucalypts (Cooke and McPhee 2007).

**Palatable plant camera placement**

* Camera traps should be positioned for the height of the browsing on palatable plants (e.g. rabbits browse up to approximately 40 cm) and positioned so they can detect this herbivory on palatable plants.  
* Camera traps should be arranged to maximise visual coverage of potential foraging areas (e.g. two camera traps; Reid et al. 2020).  
* Areas around camera traps should be cleared to roughly 25 m² (Reid et al. 2020).  
* Where long grass is present, camera traps should be placed a minimum of 1 m above ground to reduce false triggers (Reid et al. 2020).  
* Plants chosen should have significant dimensional characteristics and maintain a presence irrespective of seasonal conditions (McDonald and Brandle 2009).

### **3.2 Post-field survey tasks**

Not applicable for camera trap deployment. See Section 5.2 for post-field survey tasks required after camera trap retrieval.

## **4\. Camera trap re-equipping protocol**

### **4.1 Field collection**

#### **4.1.1 Pre-requisites**

The following tasks need to be undertaken before commencing a re-equipping field survey:

* Camera trap identification, firmware update and settings configuration (Appendix 1\)  
* SD card identification and formatting (Appendix 1\)  
* Batteries preparation (Appendix 1\)  
* Desiccant installation (humid/wet conditions; Appendix 1).

#### **4.1.2 Time requirements**

Survey time requirements will vary depending on the number and experience of personnel, the number of camera traps being re-equipped, whether any damaged or missing camera traps need to be replaced, whether additional equipment is being used and needs to be replaced, the level of follow-up site preparation required at each camera trap point, the size of the project area, and the level of difficulty in traversing the project area.

As a general guide:

* Allow one week prior to the field survey to prepare replacement camera traps, SD cards and batteries.  
* Allow 5-20 minutes at each camera trap point, depending if replacing a bait station or carcass.  
* Allow travel time between camera trap points.  
* Consider the deployment period.

#### **4.1.3 Personnel requirements**

Personnel number and skills:

* Camera trap re-equipping and recording the data directly into the app can be conducted by a single surveyor. However, it is best conducted with two personnel, one re-equipping the camera traps, and the other recording the data directly into the app.  
* The surveyor re-equipping the camera traps should be familiar with and experienced in the operation and settings of the camera traps. If surveyors are not confident, time should be dedicated to practising, using instruction manuals, and seeking advice before conducting this protocol.  
* For large project areas and camera trap arrays, camera trap re-equipping is best conducted with two or more teams in separate vehicles.  
* The use of camera traps involves interference with wildlife. Therefore, scientific permits and wildlife ethics approvals are likely to be required, so always check with your local authority. Access permissions are required.

#### **4.1.4 Equipment**

**General re-equipping equipment:**

* Mobile device (tablet/phone) with the Monitor app pre-loaded  
* GNSS receiver capable of achieving \<30 cm accuracy (e.g. Trimble R1 or DA2), hand-held GPS, or device built-in GPS (least preferred)  
* Anti-theft device keys  
* Replacement batteries as many as required per camera trap for all camera traps  
* 1 x replacement SD card per camera trap  
* Replacement camera traps (same make and model)\*  
* Replacement mounting posts (e.g. star dropper)\*  
* Replacement mounting apparatuses (e.g. cable ties, tie wire, mounting straps)\*  
* Replacement anti-theft devices and keys (e.g. cable lock straps, padlocks, security boxes)\*  
* Replacement chocks to angle camera traps to features (e.g. small wooden offcuts)\*  
* Steel post driver or mash hammer  
* Pocket tape measure  
* Protractor  
* Compass  
* Inclinometer  
* Site preparation equipment (e.g. gloves, secateurs, pruning saw, rake, shovel)  
* Hand-held digital camera, SD card image viewer or USB-C/Lightning to SD card reader  
* Rechargeable battery chargers  
* Flagging tape.

\*Ensure a suitable number of each item is taken into the field to replace any that have been damaged or are missing/stolen.

**Project dependent re-equipping equipment:**

* 1 x replacement bait or lure per bait station  
* Replacement ventilated bait containers\*  
* Replacement small olfactory lure containers\*  
* Replacement bait station mounting posts\*  
* Dust or granular insecticide for ants  
* 1 x replacement carcass per camera trap point  
* Replacement metal stakes and tie wire to secure carcasses\*  
* Replacement angle brackets (90°) and fasteners (horizontal camera trap orientation)\*  
* Replacement drift fences (directing species towards detection zone)\*  
* Replacement cork tiles (thermal contrast between tile and species)\*  
* 1 x replacement desiccant packet per camera trap (humid/wet conditions).

\*Ensure a suitable number of each item is taken into the field to replace any that have been damaged or are missing/stolen.

#### **4.1.5 Instructions and procedures**

The following steps should be followed to check and replace camera trap batteries and SD cards, and bait stations if being used, to prolong the deployment of each camera trap in the same location using the same settings and mode of deployment. If retrieving a camera trap and deploying at a new camera trap point and/or with different settings or mode of deployment, refer to the camera trap retrieval protocol (Section 5\) and then the camera trap deployment protocol (Section 3).

1. Replacement camera traps should have been prepared and calibrated prior to the field survey. If not, refer to the pre-field survey tasks (Appendix 1\) to install batteries, SD cards and desiccant packets (for humid/wet conditions), and configure the settings for each camera trap before continuing.  
2. Select the Camera Trapping Module in the Monitor app.  
3. Select Camera Trap Re-equipping.  
4. Select the relevant deployment survey label (e.g. June 30 array deployment).  
5. The start date time of the re-equipping survey will be automatically recorded. Update if required.  
6. Traverse your project area and locate a camera trap point. Approach it with the required equipment from the front to trigger a capture sequence, which is used to indicate the end of the sampling period.  
7. If the camera trap is missing, search the vicinity as it may have been dislodged and shifted by fauna. If you cannot find the camera trap, you will record it as 'Missing' in step 9\.  
8. Select the relevant deployment ID from the drop-down list.  
9. Record the re-equipping date.  
10. Keeping the camera trap mounted, open the housing and turn it off to disarm it.  
11. Turn the camera trap on and navigate to the check status function. The number of images captured, amount of space on the SD card and amount of battery power remaining will be displayed. If the display is blank, the batteries may be flat. Replace the batteries and switch the camera trap on to determine if the camera trap was not operational due to flat batteries or being damaged. Record the operational status from the drop-down list.  
12. If the operational status is 'Operational', 'SD card full', 'SD card failure' or 'Batteries flat', replace the batteries, SD card and desiccant packet (for humid/wet conditions) and record the number of images (optional) and the replacement battery type and replacement SD card number, and then skip to Step 20, or Step 17 if using a bait station, Step 18 if using a carcass, or Step 19 if you need to replace missing drift fences or cork tiles.  
13. If the operational status is 'Hardware failure', 'Unknown failure', 'Vandalism' or 'Missing/theft', consider the security risk and whether replacement is worthwhile. If it is, check the camera needs replacing checkbox.  
14. Before mounting the replacement camera trap, open the housing and check and record the replacement camera trap number, replacement battery type and replacement SD card number.  
15. Switch the replacement camera trap on and navigate to the settings menu to check that the camera trap settings have been configured to be the same as during deployment. The app will display the camera trap information and settings recorded during deployment (auto filled based on the selected deployment ID). Update the date and time as these will have changed, and the user label if changing.  
16. If the camera trap mounting post is missing, use a steel post driver or mash hammer to secure a replacement camera trap mounting post into the ground at the camera trap point. This should be the same as the initial deployment. If not, update camera trap mount. Ensure the post remains tall enough so the top of the mounted camera trap is a suitable height for your project needs (this should be the same as the initial deployment). Ensure the post is secure to prevent false triggers from movement.  
17. Using a mounting apparatus and anti-theft devices if necessary, mount the replacement camera trap. Ensure that the camera trap height, camera trap angle, camera trap direction and detection angle of the replacement camera trap are the same as during deployment (the app will display the mode of deployment).  
18. If using a bait station, replace the bait or olfactory lure in the bait container, or replace the audio or visual lure if required. Replace the bait container and mounting post if they are missing. Update camera trap mount if the replacement is not the same as the initial deployment. Ensure that the lure height, lure type and lure variety of the replacement bait station are the same as during deployment (the app will display the lure information recorded during deployment). Where ants may be a problem, spread dust or granular insecticide for ants around the base of the bait station.  
19. If using a carcass, replace the carcass. Secure the carcass to the two metal stakes using wire around the neck and hind achilles tendon. Replace the stakes and wire if they are missing. The carcass species should be the same as the initial deployment. Update if required.  
20. If using drift fences or cork tiles, replace these if they are missing.  
21. Ensure that the sensor screen and camera lens are clean.  
22. Check that there are no obstacles in front of the sensor, flash unit or camera lens (e.g. branches, mounting straps, flagging tape).  
23. If required, undertake follow-up site preparation to prevent false triggers, maximise species identification and reduce fire risk to equipment. Clear all vegetation (low hanging vegetation, grass, sticks, leaves, etc.) between the camera trap and feature. Clear vegetation at least 1 m behind the feature and at least 1 m around the camera trap (to mitigate fire damage). Consider the field of view of the sensor and clear vegetation at least 1.5 m either side of the feature.  
24. Record a camera trap photo.  
25. Test if the camera trap is positioned correctly using one of the following methods:  
    * **Walk test (if available):** open the camera trap. Switch it on and navigate to the walk test function. Close the camera trap. Test the field of view by moving your hand around the focal point while watching for the red light on the camera trap to indicate when are within the field of view. Adjust the camera trap and repeat the exercise as necessary.  
    * **Trigger the camera trap:** open the camera trap. Switch it on and arm the camera trap. Close the camera trap. Trigger the camera trap by moving your hand around the focal point. If you can review the test images on your camera trap do so. If not, switch off the camera trap, remove the SD card and view the images using a hand-held digital camera, SD card image viewer or on your device using an SD card reader. Adjust the camera trap and repeat the exercise as necessary. Delete the images before arming the camera trap.  
26. Switch on and arm the camera trap. Close the camera trap ensuring the rubber seal is clean and waterproof.  
27. Position yourself or arm or leg in the detection zone to trigger a capture sequence, which is used to indicate the start of the sampling period.  
28. Record any additional re-equipping comments regarding the re-equipping (optional), including any equipment (other than batteries, SD cards or lures) that was replaced.  
29. Select the save camera trap re-equipping button.  
30. Use flagging tape in a nearby tree to mark the location for easy camera trap re-equipping or retrieval. Ensure the flagging tape is not in the field of view of the camera trap. If there is a security risk, do not mark the location of the camera trap, it can be located using its coordinates.  
31. Repeat steps 5-30 for each camera trap point for the selected survey type.  
32. Once all camera traps for the selected survey type have been re-equipped, complete the camera trap re-equipping component. The end date time of the re-equipping survey will be automatically recorded. Update if required. Check the data summary before queuing the collection for submission.  
33. Repeat Steps 2-32 for a different survey type (creating a new collection for each) if required.

#### **4.1.6 Additional guidelines**

* It is important to confirm whether or not the camera trap was operational for the whole survey period. If there is no capture sequence upon re-equipping of the camera trap it makes it impossible to know whether it was operational for the full deployment period. For example, if the last image occurs in week 3 of 4, this could reflect either no animals at the camera trap point post week 3 or a camera malfunction sometime after this capture.  
* If the SD card was full, it is recommended that the SD card is replaced with one with greater storage capacity, or checking the SD card storage at a shorter period to maintain camera trap functionality.  
* If the batteries were flat, it is recommended that they be checked at a shorter period to maintain camera trap functionality.  
* Consider if the site preparation might have caused false triggers and undertake more clearance if necessary.  
* If the camera trap was stolen or vandalised, consider the risk of this happening again and if anti-theft devices and measures will be enough to prevent this.

### **4.2 Post-field survey tasks**

Not applicable for camera trap re-equipping. See Section 5.2 for post-field survey tasks required after camera trap retrieval.

## **5\. Camera trap retrieval protocol**

### **5.1 Field collection**

#### **5.1.1 Pre-requisites**

There are no tasks that need to be undertaken before commencing a retrieval field survey.

#### **5.1.2 Time requirements**

Survey time requirements will vary depending on the number and experience of personnel, the number of camera traps being retrieved, the size of the project area, and the level of difficulty in traversing the project area.

As a general guide:

* Allow 5-10 minutes at each camera trap point, depending if removing a bait station or carcass.  
* Allow travel time between camera trap points.

#### **5.1.3 Personnel requirements**

Personnel number and skills:

* Camera trap retrieval and recording the data directly into the app can be conducted by a single surveyor. However, it is best conducted with two personnel, one retrieving the camera traps, and the other recording the data directly into the app.  
* The surveyor retrieving the camera traps should be familiar with and experienced in the operation and settings of the camera traps. If surveyors are not confident, time should be dedicated to practising, using instruction manuals, and seeking advice before conducting this protocol.  
* For large project areas and camera trap arrays, camera trap retrieval is best conducted with two or more teams in separate vehicles.  
* The use of camera traps involves interference with wildlife. Therefore, scientific permits and wildlife ethics approvals are likely to be required, so always check with your local authority. Access permissions are required.

#### **5.1.4 Equipment**

* Mobile device (tablet/phone) with the Monitor app pre-loaded  
* GNSS receiver capable of achieving \<30 cm accuracy (e.g. Trimble R1 or DA2), hand-held GPS, or device built-in GPS (least preferred)  
* Anti-theft device keys.

#### **5.1.5 Instructions and procedures**

1. Select the Camera Trapping Module in the Monitor app.  
2. Select Camera Trap Retrieval.  
3. Select the relevant deployment survey label (e.g. June 30 array deployment).  
4. The start date time of the retrieval survey will be automatically recorded. Update if required.  
5. Traverse your project area and locate a camera trap point. Approach it with the required equipment from the front to trigger a capture sequence, which is used to indicate the end of the sampling period.  
6. If the camera trap is missing, search the vicinity as it may have been dislodged and shifted by fauna. If you cannot find the camera trap, you will record it as 'Missing' in step 10\.  
7. Select the relevant deployment ID from the drop-down list.  
8. Record the retrieval date. The app will automatically calculate the deployment period (number of camera trap nights based on the deployment date).  
9. Open the camera trap and turn it off to disarm it.  
10. Turn the camera trap on and navigate to the check status function. The number of images captured, amount of space on the SD card and amount of battery power remaining will be displayed. If the display is blank, the batteries may be flat. Replace the batteries and switch the camera trap on to determine if the camera trap was not operational due to flat batteries or being damaged. Record the operational status from the drop-down. Record the number of images (optional).  
11. Switch off and close the camera trap.  
12. Record any additional retrieval comments (optional).  
13. Select the save camera trap retrieval button.  
14. Remove the camera trap and bait container (if bait station used) from the mounting posts, and remove the mounting posts. Remove any materials used to secure the carcass (if used). Remove any flagging tape used to mark the location of the camera trap.  
15. Ensure all equipment is packed appropriately for transport. Camera traps, in particular the PIR sensor, may become damaged if they are left loose in a vehicle or backpack.  
16. Repeat steps 5-15 for each camera trap point for the selected survey type.  
17. Once all camera traps for the selected survey type have been retrieved, complete the camera trap retrieval component. The end date time of the retrieval survey will be automatically recorded. Update if required. Check the data summary before queuing the collection for submission.  
18. Repeat Steps 1-17 for a different survey type (creating a new collection for each) if required.

#### **5.1.6 Additional guidelines**

It is important to confirm whether or not the camera trap was operational for the whole survey period. If there is no capture sequence upon retrieval of the camera trap it makes it impossible to know whether it was operational for the full deployment period. For example, if the last image occurs in week 3 of 4, this could reflect either no animals at the camera trap point post week 3 or a camera malfunction sometime after this capture.

### **5.2 Post-field survey tasks**

#### **5.2.1 Data curation**

* When back in the office, backup the media data (images and video) from the camera trap SD cards for long-term storage and processing, to a server of your choosing.  
* Media data should not be deleted from SD cards until it has been checked that they have been backed up successfully.  
* It is good practice to keep an additional back-up of media data (e.g. cloud storage, external hard-drive) until electronic delivery of the receiving server.  
* Once all data is backed up and checked, a good practice is to clear all SD cards, preferably by formatting. This ensures that SD cards are working correctly and prevents full cards from being reloaded into camera traps in future deployments.  
* Arrange for electronic delivery of the media data to the receiving server (see the Submitting EMSA Digital Media information sheet).  
* This will involve linking the project administration data and camera trap survey data to the media data via the project number, deployment number, camera trap number and SD card number.

## **6\. Data submission**

Data from the Camera trapping Module is collected in the field using the Monitor app. Data entry is completed in the app and photos are taken using the app (or later linked if taken on other devices. All data is checked for correctness and completeness in the app before it is submitted.

Once all data is finalised and marked as completed, the data is submitted from the Monitor app to the staging server by an explicit user action. If the device is offline at the time, the data will be pushed as soon as it is reconnected to a network (i.e. either back in mobile phone range or a wi-fi network). The local herbaria (or approved taxonomist) completing the field name identifications uses data curation tools to submit the taxonomic determinations to the staging server. Once field survey and taxonomic determination data reaches the staging server it is prepared in an export interface for delivery to the Biodiversity Data Repository. DCCEEW is then responsible for managing the data. In the future, it is anticipated that data curation tools will be made available to project personnel.

## **7\. Data use and reason for collection**

### **7.1 Data use to date**

Camera trap deployment is not currently undertaken by TERN's Ecosystem Surveillance platform. For potential uses of the camera trap data collected as part of the Camera Traps Module, see Future use of the data below.

### **7.2 Future use of the data**

Camera trap data has several potential applications, including: documenting the presence of a species within a project area or specific habitat or feature of interest in that area (DSEWPAC 2011; Cotsell and Vernes 2016); systematically documenting spatial patterns of vertebrate biodiversity (TEAM Network 2011; Gillespie et al. 2015; Bush Heritage Australia 2021); determining the spatial distribution of species known to be amenable to camera trapping (Meek 2018); assessing behaviour, such as pollinator visitation and activity patterns (Barata et al. 2018; Krauss et al. 2018; Potter et al. 2021); estimating population density by monitoring uniquely marked individuals of a species (Ramsey et al. 2015; Moore et al 2020a); monitoring changes in the occurrence and distribution of individual species, a suite of species, or community over time (TEAM Network 2011); and evaluating management outcomes (e.g. documenting changes in the occurrence and abundance of vertebrate pest species in accordance with a lethal baiting program; Moseby and Read 2014; Meek 2018).

Camera traps are generally used as point-based sampling devices, and many analytical methods exist for the data they collect, such as photographic rates of species (Di Bitetti et al. 2014), occupancy models, which estimate species occurrence while accounting for imperfect detection and can reveal species-habitat associations (Tobler et al. 2015), capture-recapture models, which estimate abundance and detection probability from individual detection/non-detection data and are applicable to camera-trap data for individually recognizable species (Borchers et al. 2014), and spatial capture-recapture models, which extend the capture-recapture framework by accounting for animal movement and location relative to the trap array (Royle et al. 2009). Several methods have been developed to estimate abundance for species that cannot be individually identified (Bengsen et al. 2011; Gilbert et al. 2021). Finally, as well as describe activity patterns, time stamps on camera-trap records can be used to describe temporal interactions between species (Frey et al. 2017). Considering the usefulness of camera trapping, continued development of analytical approaches for camera-trap data can be expected (Sollmann 2018), as well as computer processes and programs to manage camera trapping datasets and automate image processing (Niedballa et al. 2016; Norouzzadeh et al. 2018).

## **9\. Appendices**

### **Appendix 1\. Pre-field survey tasks**

#### **Camera trap identification**

Before camera traps are deployed in the field they need to be allocated and marked with an identification number. Camera traps should also be registered in an equipment management database (e.g. spreadsheet) to keep track of their location (e.g. in storage, assigned to project \#), current firmware, and operational status (e.g. functional, damaged; TEAM Network 2011).

1. Clearly mark the camera trap externally with a unique identification number (e.g. 01, 02, 03\) using a permanent, water-resistant marker.  
2. Open the camera trap and mark it internally with the same unique identification number as marked externally.  
3. Retrieve the serial number of the camera trap from the white sticker underneath the control panel.  
4. Record the camera trap number and camera trap serial number in an equipment management database. Other data you may wish to record includes the camera trap make, model, purchase date, firmware, operational status and current location.  
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for each camera trap.

#### **Camera trap firmware update**

Camera trap manufacturers regularly provide firmware updates for their camera traps. Ensure you check the relevant website for updates and instructions for updating before each field survey or camera trap redeployment. As an example, the steps to update the firmware on Reconyx camera traps are provided below (Bush Heritage Australia 2021).

1. Navigate to the support tab and firmware updates link on the Reconyx website to access the most recent firmware update. Updates are provided on an approximately annual basis.  
2. Check the list of Reconyx camera trap models for the relevant update. HC500, HC550, HC600 and PC850 models generally all have the same update.  
3. Upload the firmware update onto an empty SD card.  
4. Insert the SD card into your Reconyx camera trap.  
5. Switch on your Reconyx camera trap and firmware updates will automatically occur.  
6. Reconyx firmware updates since 2016 have maintained the current camera trap settings. Check or set camera trap settings after firmware updates are completed.  
7. Repeat steps 4-6 for all remaining Reconyx camera traps.

#### **Camera trap settings configuration**

Configure your camera trap settings before going into the field. Refer to the user manual for your camera trap make and model for instructions to navigate the control panel.

1. Open the camera trap and insert a spare set of batteries to configure the settings.  
2. Switch the camera trap on and navigate to the control menu based on the user manual for your camera trap.  
3. Select a pre-programmed settings option, or program customised settings (see following steps).  
4. Set the media type (i.e. image and/or video).  
5. For images, set the number of images per trigger.  
6. For images, set the image interval in seconds.  
7. For videos, set the video length in minutes and seconds.  
8. Set the sensor sensitivity.  
9. Set the quiet period in minutes and seconds.  
10. Set the aspect ratio.  
11. For images, set the image quality in megapixels.  
12. For videos, set the video resolution.  
13. Set time lapse (on/off). If turned on, set the time lapse interval in minutes and seconds, and time lapse schedules.  
14. Set day/night recording.  
15. Set the night mode shutter speed in seconds.  
16. Set the time format.  
17. Set the date and time.  
18. Set the unit of temperature.  
19. Set the user label (i.e. relevant project, camera and/or camera trap point code).  
20. Set the battery type to match the batteries that will be used during the survey.  
21. Repeat steps 1-20 for each camera trap.

#### **SD card identification**

Before SD cards are used in camera traps that are deployed in the field, they need to be allocated and marked with an identification number. Similar to camera traps, SD cards should also be registered in an equipment management database to keep track of their location (e.g. in storage, assigned to project \#, assigned to camera \#) and operational status (e.g. functional, damaged; TEAM Network 2011).

1. Clearly mark the SD card externally with a unique identification number (e.g. 01, 02, 03\) using a permanent, water resistant marker.  
2. Retrieve the serial number of the SD card from the back of the SD card.  
3. Record the SD card number and SD card serial number of each SD card in an equipment management database. Other data you may wish to record includes the SD card brand, type (SD, SDHC, SDHX), purchase date, storage capacity, format (e.g. FAT32), format date, and current location.  
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for each SD card.

#### **SD card formatting**

Formatting an SD card effectively erases all the card data, giving you a fresh, empty folder structure to work with. After you have backed up your SD card after each field survey, you should format each SD card before the next field survey. This will ensure data from different surveys is not mixed up. Furthermore, regular formatting of SD cards can lower the risk of corrupt files.

1. Ensure your data from the previous field survey is backed up.  
2. Insert the SD card into your computer's SD card reader (or use an external SD card reader).  
3. For Windows, you should see your SD card under the list of available drives. Right-click on the drive and select format. Under file system select 'FAT32' if the SD card is 32 GB or smaller. If the SD card is 64 GB or greater, select 'ExFAT' then click on start. Select ok to ignore the warning that the data on the drive will be erased and begin formatting the SD card.  
4. For Mac, open disk utility and select the SD card on the left side of the window. Click on the erase tab and then click on the format drop-down menu. Select 'MS-DOS (FAT)' if the SD card is 32 GB or smaller. If the SD card is 64 GB or greater, select 'ExFAT'. Click erase. Your Mac will delete the contents of your SD card and format it.  
5. Record the SD card format and format date of each SD card in an equipment management database.  
6. Insert the formatted SD card into a camera trap so it is ready for the survey.  
7. Repeat steps 1-6 for each SD card.

#### **Batteries preparation**

Each camera trap can require up to 12 AA batteries depending on the make and model. Batteries should be selected after consulting the user manual of the camera traps you are using and consideration of your study requirements. The three most common battery types used are rechargeable nickel-metal hydride (NiMH), lithium and alkaline.

1. If using rechargeable NiMH batteries and charging the batteries for the first time, or the first time for a given field season, put them in a discharging-recharging cycle (conditioning cycle) at least 48 hours before leaving for the field. This ensures that the battery memory is properly set and prolongs the life of the rechargeable battery. Refer to the battery charger for instructions to put the batteries into a condition cycle. Only use battery chargers that have this specification. Depending on the number of camera traps you have, multiple large battery chargers may be required to be used in parallel to prepare for the field.  
2. If not charging the rechargeable NiMH batteries for the first time, discharge them first and recharge them for at least 24 hours before leaving for the field survey.  
3. Once the rechargeable NiMH batteries are finished charging, check they have adequate voltage using a voltmeter. Rechargeable batteries will show a lower voltage than their posted voltage of 1.5 V, but this is normal for these battery types (between 1.25 and 1.3 V).  
4. Try not to charge the rechargeable NiMH batteries more than 2-3 days before taking them into the field.  
5. Within 1-2 days of the field survey, insert new lithium or alkaline, or charged NiMH batteries into each camera trap so they are ready for the survey. Do not mix battery types.  
6. Do not use the rechargeable NiMH batteries prepared for the field survey to configure the camera trap settings (see above). Use a spare set of batteries.

#### **Desiccant installation**

If the camera traps are being deployed in humid or wet conditions, desiccant (silica gel) can be placed inside the camera trap housings to help protect the electronics from moisture.

1. Open the camera trap housing and place a packet of desiccant inside.  
2. Close the camera trap housing.  
3. Repeat steps 1-2 for each camera trap.

#### **Camera trap array development and upload**

1. Review ecological information for the target taxa/species to inform the number, spacing and shape of the camera trap array. GIS spatial data layers (e.g. vegetation mapping, access tracks, landform), along with any other information relevant to the project, are also useful in determining an array.  
2. Upload a csv file of the proposed array to your mobile device, with 'Name', 'Latitude' and 'Longitude' columns, and with latitude and longitude in decimal degrees.

### **Appendix 2\. Study design and planning considerations**

Proper attention must be given to the design of camera trapping studies, including the target species, the make and model of the camera trap used, the camera settings used, the mode of camera trap deployment, and what data is collected and how it will be analysed. Poorly designed surveys often result in data which cannot be used to answer the question of interest (Gillespie et al. 2015). A clear and defined statement of the study objectives and why camera traps are the best survey tool to achieve these objectives is therefore an important component of camera trapping studies. The study design and methodology should align with the clearly defined objectives (Meek et al. 2014a).

Study design and planning considerations for camera trapping surveys are detailed in the sections below, and cover:

* A camera trap decision key  
* Quick reference deployment guidelines  
* Factors affecting detection  
* Target species  
* Camera trap selection  
* Camera trap point selection and preparation  
* Mode of deployment  
* Camera trap settings  
* Lures  
* The number and density of camera traps  
* Camera trap arrays  
* Deployment period  
* SD cards  
* Batteries  
* Storage and transport  
* Permits and ethics.

#### **Quick reference deployment guidelines**

The quick reference deployment guidelines (see table below) provide informed deployment recommendations for various taxa (e.g. small, medium-sized and large mammals, invasive predators, reptiles), including for the following aspects of camera trap deployment:

* Camera trap selection  
* Camera trap point selection and preparation  
* Mode of deployment  
* Camera trap settings  
* Lures  
* The number and density of camera trap points  
* Deployment period.

Each of these aspects is discussed more broadly in the sections below.

**Quick reference camera trap deployment guidelines.** Deployment guidelines for various Australian taxa based on those used in relevant studies and those recommended in relevant guidelines (shown in bold).
