## [cite_start]Version control [cite: 13]

[cite_start]Readers are advised that this datasheet will undergo revision as the EMSA Monitor app undergoes new refinement and updated versions become available. [cite: 14] [cite_start]The names of the fields may vary slightly from the modules and the datasheet during this process. [cite: 15]

| Datasheet version | Date | Version update overview |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1.0 | 7 May 2024 | Release of the datasheet matching Monitor version 1.0.1 |
| 2 | 4 July 2025 | DRAFT of the datasheet matching Monitor version 1.0.7 |

## [cite_start]Instruction [cite: 17]

[cite_start]This datasheet can be used if the Monitor app is not accessible at the time of a field survey. [cite: 18] [cite_start]The datasheet has been designed to match the EMSA module manual and the Monitor app workflow. [cite: 19] [cite_start]However, there are some minor differences, as capturing the quantity and complexity of the data in hard-copy form is difficult to replicate. [cite: 20] [cite_start]At times some additional information or less information is collected on the datasheet. [cite: 21] [cite_start]An example is that the app would readily collect location, date, and time information for each input with minimal user effort, while the datasheet version only collects the survey start and end location, date, and time. [cite: 22]

[cite_start]Surveyors must follow the EMSA module manual as though they are using Monitor by following the Instructions and Procedures section of the relevant protocol, but instead of entering the data in Monitor, data is entered on the datasheet. [cite: 23] [cite_start]Surveyors are reminded to check the module manual to ensure that the mandatory pre-survey and prerequisites have been completed before undertaking the module. [cite: 24] [cite_start]A key example is that the Plot Selection and Layout Module must be completed before undertaking all plot-based protocols. [cite: 25]

[cite_start]This datasheet can either be printed and used in the field with a pencil or used digitally on a device. [cite: 26] [cite_start]Regional Delivery Partners are responsible for manually entering datasheet-collected data into Monitor once the app is fully functional again. [cite: 27] [cite_start]The Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water requires that digital scans of the datasheets be uploaded into MERIT. [cite: 28]

### [cite_start]DEAD WOOD OBSERVATION - DROPDOWN FIELD OPTIONS [cite: 42]

**Decay class**
* **1:** Recently fallen. [cite_start]Structurally intact or almost so; bark or small branches still attached, few signs of wood decay; wood mostly retains original colour. [cite: 43, 44, 45]
* [cite_start]**2:** Structurally less intact but still hard when kicked; small branches absent; little or no bark present; early signs of wood decay, bark loss or discolouration. [cite: 46, 47, 48]
* [cite_start]**3:** Clearly decaying but still supports own weight may be slightly soft when kicked; may be hollow in places; no bark; moss and fungi may be prominent. [cite: 49, 50, 51]
* [cite_start]**4:** Cannot support its own weight; soft to kick (but may still be hard in places, in which case may be extensively hollow); moss, fungi and invading roots likely. [cite: 52, 53, 54]
* [cite_start]**5:** No longer retains original shape; wood very soft or largely disintegrated; sometimes only outline visible beneath moss, invading roots. [cite: 55, 56]
