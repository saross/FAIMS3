# Assessment: Generating FAIMS3 Notebooks from Prompts

## Overall Assessment

**Yes, I can generate functional FAIMS3 notebook JSON from prompts.** Based on my analysis of the codebase, I have access to:

1. Complete JSON schema definition
2. TypeScript interfaces for type safety
3. All available components and their parameters
4. Multiple working examples
5. Validation rules and patterns

## My Capabilities

### 1. Structure Generation ✓
I can create properly structured JSON with:
- Valid metadata section
- Complete ui-specification with fields, fviews, viewsets, and visible_types
- Proper field IDs and references

### 2. Component Selection ✓
I can choose appropriate components based on requirements:
- Text inputs for various data types
- Selection controls for constrained choices
- Media capture for photos
- Location capture via GPS or maps
- File uploads
- Special fields like QR scanners and auto-incrementers

### 3. Validation Rules ✓
I can implement validation using Yup array syntax:
- Type validation (string, number, array, etc.)
- Required field validation
- Min/max constraints
- Pattern matching
- Complex validation chains

### 4. Conditional Logic ✓
I can create conditional field display based on:
- Simple equality checks
- Complex AND/OR conditions
- Multi-field dependencies

### 5. Relationships ✓
I can set up:
- Related record selectors
- Parent-child relationships between forms
- Templated fields that reference other fields

## Optimal Prompt Structure

To generate the best notebooks, prompts should include:

### 1. **Context and Purpose**
```
"I need a notebook for [archaeological excavation / ecological survey / infrastructure inspection]"
```

### 2. **Data Collection Requirements**
```
"We need to collect:
- Site identification (text, auto-generated ID)
- Location (GPS coordinates)
- Photos of findings
- Multiple species observed (multi-select)
- Measurements (numeric fields)"
```

### 3. **Workflow Information**
```
"The workflow is:
1. Create a new site record
2. Add multiple artifact records linked to the site
3. Each artifact needs photos and measurements"
```

### 4. **Validation Requirements**
```
"Requirements:
- Site name is required and must be unique
- GPS location is mandatory
- At least one photo per artifact
- Depth measurements between 0-500cm"
```

### 5. **User Roles (if applicable)**
```
"Access levels:
- Admin: full access
- Team: can create/edit records
- Viewer: read-only access"
```

## Example Prompt → Notebook Generation

### Good Prompt Example:
```
"Create a notebook for archaeological survey with:
- Site records containing: name, type (dropdown: cave/open/structure), GPS location, site description
- Artifact records linked to sites with: artifact ID (auto-generated), type (dropdown), photos, findspot description, depth
- Make GPS and at least one photo required for sites
- Organize site fields into 'Basic Info' and 'Location' sections"
```

### What I Would Generate:
- Proper metadata with archaeological context
- Site form with:
  - Text field for name with required validation
  - Select dropdown for site type
  - TakePoint component for GPS (required)
  - MultipleTextField for description
  - TakePhoto for site photos (required)
- Artifact form with:
  - BasicAutoIncrementer for ID
  - Select for artifact type
  - RelatedRecordSelector to link to sites
  - TakePhoto for artifact photos
  - TextField for findspot
  - NumberField for depth with min/max validation
- Proper form organization into sections
- Relationship configuration between forms

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **Component Constraints**: I can only use components available in the codebase
2. **Validation Complexity**: Complex cross-field validation may need custom implementation
3. **UI Presentation**: The actual rendering depends on the FAIMS3 app implementation
4. **Performance**: Very large notebooks with many fields may need optimization
5. **Testing Required**: Generated notebooks should be tested in the actual FAIMS3 environment

## Recommendations

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic notebooks and add complexity gradually
2. **Test Incrementally**: Test each section/form as you build
3. **Use Examples**: Reference working examples for complex features
4. **Validate JSON**: Ensure JSON is valid and matches schema
5. **Consider Users**: Design with field workers' needs in mind

## Conclusion

I can effectively generate FAIMS3 notebook JSON from well-structured prompts. The system is flexible enough to handle various research scenarios while maintaining data quality through validation and structured relationships. The key to success is providing clear requirements in the prompt, including data types, relationships, validation rules, and workflow context.
