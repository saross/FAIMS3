## Best Practices for Field Design

### 1. **Start Simple**
Begin with essential fields and add complexity only as needed.

### 2. **Use Consistent Naming**
- Sites: SITE-001, SITE-002
- Samples: SAMP-2024-001
- Features: F-01, F-02

### 3. **Group Related Fields**
Put related information together:
- Location section: GPS, site name, grid reference
- Sample section: Type, quantity, storage
- Environmental section: Weather, soil, vegetation

### 4. **Consider Data Export**
- Dropdowns create consistent data for analysis
- Free text is harder to analyze later
- Numbers are better than text for measurements

### 5. **Test in the Field**
- Is text too small on mobile?
- Are dropdown lists too long?
- Can you enter data with gloves on?

## Getting Help

When designing your form, consider:
- What data do you need to collect?
- How will you analyze it later?
- What conditions will you be working in?
- Who will be entering the data?

Remember: The best form is one that captures your essential data efficiently and accurately in field conditions.
